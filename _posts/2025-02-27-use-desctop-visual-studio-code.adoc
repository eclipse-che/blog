== Introduction

Eclipse Che provides developers with a web version of the link:https://github.com/microsoft/vscode[Visual Studio Code OSS] editor, which includes most of the desktop version features. The transition to cloud development can feel quite unusual for developers, but Eclipse Che has a feature that will help you feel right at home immediately.
With link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line[Visual Studio Code Command Line Interface (CLI)] you can create a tunnel that allows you to connect your familiar local Visual Studio Code to your workspace.

== Connecting Visual Studio Code desktop to a new workspace

You can connect your local Visual Studio Code to a new workpace with a few clicks.
First, create a workspace on the Che Dashboard and choose Visual Studio Code (desktop) as your editor.

{nbsp} +

Wait for the login page to appear and log in with your Microsoft or GitHub account.
Click the *Copy & Continue to Microsoft* or *Copy & Continue to GitHub* button to copy the authentication code to the clipboard and to open the authenticating pop-up.

{nbsp} +

Complete the authentication process, paste in the code from the clipboard, and follow the instructions. On successful authentication, close the pop-up and wait for the tunnel to your workspace to be created.

{nbsp} +

Click *Open in Visual Studio Code desktop* to open your workspace in the desktop version of Visual Studio Code. Confirm opening the desktop application by clicking Open Visual Studio Code - URL Handler.

Wait for the local Visual Studio Code and allow the *Remote - Tunnels* extension to open the URI.

[NOTE]
====
If Visual Studio Code opens your workspace with a delay, open the *Remote Explorer* view.

== Connecting Visual Studio Code desktop to a running workspace

=== Prepare your local Visual Studio Code.

First, you need to install both link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-server[Remote - Tunnels] and link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-explorer[Remote Explorer] extensions to your local Visual Studio Code. It will allow you to connect to a remote machine via a secure tunnel.

=== Install Visual Studio Code CLI.

Next, you need to install Visual Studio Code CLI in your workspace. Open a terminal and run the following command to install Visual Studio Code CLI in the `/checode` directory.

[source, code]
----
curl 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=cli-alpine-x64' --location -o /tmp/code.tar.gz && \
tar -xvzf /tmp/code.tar.gz --directory=/checode
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you don't have `gzip` installed in your workspace, you won't be able to install the CLI using the command above.

In this case you need to:

. link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[download CLI] for *Linux x64* architecture to your desktop

. unpack and upload the extracted binary to your workspace root

. move the binary to `/checode` directory and make it executable by `mv $PROJECT_SOURCE/code /checode && chmod +x /checode/code`
====

By placing the Visual Studio Code CLI binary in the `/checode` directory, you will preserve it if the workspace is restarted.

=== Create a secure tunnel to the Cloud Development Environment.

Open workspace terminal and launch the Visual Studio Code CLI with the command below.

[source,code]
----
/checode/code tunnel --accept-server-license-terms --name $DEVWORKSPACE_NAME
----

Log in using your Microsoft or GitHub account.

image::/assets/img/use-desktop-visual-studio-code/cli-create-tunnel.png["Create a secure tunnel to the workpace"]

After successful login, you will see the information about the created tunnel and will be prompted to open the workspace in your browser.

=== Open your workspace using local Visual Studio Code.

Open your local Visual Studio Code and navigate to the *Remote Explorer* view. A tunnel to your workspace will appear.
With the buttons on the right, open your workspace in the current or a new window.

{nbsp} +

[NOTE]
====
A tunnel to your workspace will not appear if you are not signed in yet.
Sign in using the same account you used to create the tunnel.
====

You are now equipped to develop locally within a Cloud Development Environment.
Happy coding!
