== Introduction

Last year, the link:https://youtu.be/eIOZq_e-Fjs?si=lecaEpLC5vEb0-Za["Pros and cons of using Kubernetes as a development platform"]  session was presented at link:https://www.eclipse.org/events/2023/eclipsecon/[EclipseCon] in Ludwigsburg. The main message was that, indeed, link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] is complex, and sometimes there are caveats and tradeoffs to make, but it is evolving rapidly with plenty of new features and opportunities available with every release. Today it is time to reflect a bit more on this topic. 

== Building an application platform for developers

In general, if you are considering building your own development platform it is recommended to read the brilliant link:https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/production-kubernetes/9781492092292/[“Production Kubernetes”] book, where the multitude of potential options is described in great detail:

Of course, you can always craft your own platform from scratch, or even decide that the link:https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0[cloud], in general, is not your cup of tea, and stop the Cloud Development Environment (CDE) journey right here since local development is good enough for your use-case and works “just fine”. However, in link:https://eclipse.dev/che/[Eclipse Che] we strongly believe in the hybrid cloud strategy, and that Kubernetes is one of the best possible options for building a modern CDE platform for developers because of:

- Extensibility
- Scalability
- Resource Efficiency
- Consistency
- High Availability
- Control
- Open Source
- Community
- Vendor Neutrality
- Hybrid-Cloud Nature

However, there are a lot of subtle details worth considering when using Kubernetes as the pillar for building  an application platform for developers. Some of them are described in the dedicated link:https://youtu.be/eIOZq_e-Fjs?si=w6_Nx-v4nwg85QgP[EclipseCon’s session]mentioned in the introduction. In this article you can find a few more.

== Conclusion

We trust in Kubernetes and do believe in the hybrid cloud. Open Source is in our DNA.
