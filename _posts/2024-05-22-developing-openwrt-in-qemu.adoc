https://openwrt.org/[OpenWrt] is a highly extensible GNU/Linux distribution for embedded devices (typically wireless routers). OpenWrt is built from the ground up to be a full-featured, easily modifiable operating system for embedded devices. You can have all the features you need with no bloat, powered by a modern Linux kernel.

We can create and develop https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/creating-a-cmake-package-in-openwrt[OpenWRT CMake packages] with Eclipse Che.

In this blog post, we will review developing OpenWRT in https://www.qemu.org/[QEMU] with Eclipse Che in 4 parts:

<<part1>>

<<part2>>

<<part3>>

<<part4>>


NOTE: In this blog post, we will use https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package.git[OpenWrt HelloWorld package].


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
First of all, we need to create a new workspace from the repo https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package.git[openwrt-helloworld-package] with Eclipse Che. The easiest way to do it is to use https://eclipse.dev/che/docs/stable/hosted-che/hosted-che/[Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat] and create a workspace by navigating to the following URL - https://workspaces.openshift.com#https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package/blob/main/devfile.yaml

## PART 1: Quick start with prebuild recourses [[part1]]

Prebuilt resources could be applied for a quick start with Eclipse Che. We could do this by running the next tasks from the https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package/blob/main/devfile.yaml[devfile]:

1. `Add prebuilt resources`

NOTE: After adding prebuilt resources, we should see the `openwrt-*.img.gz` file in the `output` directory. Prebuilt resources were added to the runtime image during the last successful GitHub image build action.

## PART 2: (optinal)Build all packages and the kernel [[part2]]

After creating a new workspace from https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package.git[openwrt-helloworld-package] we need to install all package definitions, copy https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package/blob/main/configs/.x86-generic.config[`.config`] file and build all packages and the kernel. We can do it by running the following tasks from the https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package/blob/main/devfile.yaml[devfile]:

1. `Install all package definitions`
2. `Copy diff-config to OpenWRT`
3. `Build all packages and the kernel`

NOTE: The build process may take a while. After the build is complete, we can see the `openwrt-*.img.gz` file in the `output` directory.

## PART 3: Run OpenWRT in QEMU [[part3]]

After adding prebuilt resources or building all packages and the kernel, OpenWRT could be run in the QEMU VM by running the following tasks from the https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package/blob/main/devfile.yaml[devfile]:

1. `Running OpenWRT in a QEMU VM`

After running the task, we see the OpenWRT booting in the QEMU machine emulator and virtualizer.

image::/assets/img/developing-openwrt/running-openwrt-in-qemu-vm.png[Running OpenWRT in a QEMU VM]
{nbsp} +

We can access the OpenWRT console by running the task `Remote access to OpenWRT via SSH` and start the helloworld package by running:

[source, bash]
----
helloworld
----

## PART 4: Debugging helloworld package [[part4]]

After starting OpenWRT in a QEMU VM, we need to run a remote gdbserver for debugging. We can do it by running the task `Start remote GDB Server` from the https://github.com/che-incubator/openwrt-helloworld-package/blob/main/devfile.yaml[devfile].

image::/assets/img/developing-openwrt/start-remote-gdbserver.png[Start remote gdbserver]
{nbsp} +

Then, we can debug the helloworld package with IDE:

NOTE: The task `Start remote GDB Server` should be run before each new debug session.
