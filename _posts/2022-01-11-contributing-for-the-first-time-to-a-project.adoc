=== Introduction

The complexity of applications has changed dramatically over the last decade, and nowadays it is not always straightforward to contribute to a new project for the first time.
At the beginning, developers need to properly set up the local environment including:

- build tools
- runtimes
- dependencies
- IDEs

For complex projects, it could easily take weeks for new developers to get the builds running on their machines.
In general, a significant amount of the team's week is spent on building and maintaining developer environments.
With {prod} we are solving the complexity of the onboarding, configuration, and setup by defining a new cloud-native, zero-install, and repeatable concept of a workspace.

=== Contributing for the first time to a project using {prod}

The motto of {prod} is that anyone anytime can contribute to a project without installing software.
In order to contribute to a project, just click on the badge defined in the `README.md` file of the repository, and within a minute you will get a workspace ready for development with all the tools and runtimes available out of the box.

By default, {prod} is using a customized version of link:https://theia-ide.org/[Theia], which provides link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code]-like experience including the support of extensions:

.{prod} Theia IDE
image::/assets/img/contribute-to-a-project/ide.png[{prod} Theia IDE]
{empty}

Programming languages facilities like code completion, navigation, and CodeLens are provided using the link:https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/[Language Server Protocol]. {prod} benefits from a growing ecosystem of over 60 available language servers, delivering intelligent editing support for all major programming languages. 

.Java Content Assist

Pre-defined commands (`Terminal` -> `Run Task...`) allow you to easily build, run, debug, and test the application.

.Pre-defined commands

{empty}

Additional extensions can be enabled by using the `Ctrl+Shift+J` shortcut or `View` -> `Plugins` menu items:

.The 'Plugins' view
image::/assets/img/contribute-to-a-project/plugins.png[The 'Plugins' view]
{empty}

Debug the application by using the `F5` shortcut or `Run` -> `Start Debugging` menu items:

.Debugging Java application
image::/assets/img/contribute-to-a-project/debug.png[Debugging the application]
{empty}

Commit and push the changes from the terminal or use the `Source Control` view:

.The 'Source Control' view

Now you are ready for the first contribution. For GitHub, a dedicated plugin is available that allows opening pull requests right from the IDE:

=== How can maintainers set up their projects to use {prod}? [[set-up-project]]

- Deploy {prod} on a {orch-name} cluster or use link:https://workspaces.openshift.com/[Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat].

WARNING: At the moment, link:https://workspaces.openshift.com/[Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat] does not use the {devworkspace} Operator that is in charge of the devfile v2 support.
The switch to the {devworkspace} engine is planned for spring 2022.
Currently, devfiles v2 are automatically converted to devfile v1 equivalents via the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/devfile-converter[converter library] under the hood during workspace startup.

.The recommended file structure of the repository
----
  |--- devfile.yaml
  |--- README.md
  |___ .che
         |___ che-editor.yaml
         |___ che-theia-plugins.yaml
  |___ .vscode
         |___ extensions.json
         |___ launch.json
----

- Add `.devfile.yaml` or `devfile.yaml` file to the root of the project in order to specify the relevant components and commands in a declarative way.

The devfile provides easy to configure, highly reproducible definitions of portable developer environments.
For more information about devfiles, see the link:https://devfile.io/[Devfile Documentation].

NOTE: Omitting the creation of the devfile file will result in using a default container based on the link:https://quay.io/repository/devfile/universal-developer-image[Universal Developer Image],
which provides various languages (including Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Golang, etc) and tools (including `curl`, `jq`, `git`, etc).

- Add the `.vscode/extensions.json` file to the root of the project in order to add VS Code extensions if the editor is Theia (the default) or VS Code:

[source,json]
----
{  
  "recommendations": [
    "redhat.java"  
  ]  
}
----

IMPORTANT: The list of VS Code extensions is available in the {prod} plug-in registry.
If the specified extensions are not available in the registry, the workspace will start, but the extensions will not be added to the workspace. 

- Add the `.vscode/launch.json` file for specifying `Run` and `Debug` commands if the editor is Theia or VS Code:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Debug (Attach) - Remote",
            "request": "attach",
            "hostName": "localhost",
            "port": 5005
        }
    ]
}
----

- Add the `.che/che-theia-plugins.yaml` file if extra customizations of Theia plugins are required. 

NOTE: {prod} uses `.che/che-theia-plugins.yaml` file only if the editor is Theia.

For example, overriding the default memory limit of `redhat.java` sidecar container:

[source,yaml]
----
- id: redhat/java  
  override:  
    sidecar:  
      memoryLimit: 2Gi
----

- Add the `.che/che-editor.yaml` file to override the default editor (Theia) with a different one (e.g. VS Code or JetBrains IntelliJ) and specify the editor container properties. For example, overriding the default memory limit of the `theia-ide` container:

[source,yaml]
----
id: eclipse/che-theia/latest          # mandatory
registryUrl: https://my-registry.com  # optional
override:                             # optional
  containers:
    - name: theia-ide
      memoryLimit: 1280Mi
----

- Add the {prod} badge to the project `README.md` file with a link for starting a workspace:

.The official {prod} badge
image::https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg[Contribute Badge]
{empty}

====
`[![Contribute](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/my/repository])`
====

Once the line above is added to the `README.md`, it will be possible to start a workspace by simply clicking on the badge icon.

NOTE: {prod} images from link:https://simpleicons.org/?q=eclipse-che[Simple Icons] can be also used for generation of the custom badges via link:https://shields.io/[Shields IO].

- Set up link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/try-in-web-ide[Try in Web IDE] GitHub action in the repository in order to test and review pull requests with {prod}.
More details about the GitHub action can be found in the link:https://che.eclipseprojects.io/2021/10/18/@david.kwon-test-pull-requests-with-the-try-in-web-ide-github-action.html[Test pull requests with the Try in Web IDE GitHub action] blog post.

Now you are all set. Happy Coding!
