Even though the current trend is to split an infrastructure into a number of 'Fit For Purpose' clusters instead of having a gigantic monolith {kubernetes} cluster, administrators still want to provide granular access and restrict certain functionality for particular users.

NOTE: A 'Fit For Purpose' {kubernetes} cluster refers to a cluster that is specifically designed and configured to meet the requirements and goals of a particular use case or workload, tailored to optimize performance, resource utilization, and other factors based on the characteristics of the workloads it will be managing. For {prod} it is recommended to have this type of cluster provisioned.

Previously, all users provisioned on a {kubernetes} cluster had access to {prod}, and it was difficult to restrict the usage for certain accounts. One of the options for administrators was to remove permissions for namespace / project creation on the {kubernetes} level, and disable automatic namespace provisioning for {prod}:

[source,yaml]
----
devEnvironments:
  defaultNamespace:
    autoProvision: false
----

Considering this, new optional properties that allow setting up granular access for different groups and users have been added to the {prod} Custom Resource: `allowUsers`, `allowGroups`, `denyUsers`, and `denyGroups`. Below you can find an illustration exemplifying the configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
 networking:
    auth:
      advancedAuthorization:
        allowUsers:
          - user-a
          - user-b
        denyUsers:
          - user-c
        allowGroups:
          - team-a
          - team-b
        denyGroups:
          - team-c
----

IMPORTANT: `AllowGroups` and `DenyGroups` properties are only supported on OpenShift.

Users who are not allowed will not be able to use {prod} and will see the following warning when trying to access the User Dashboard:

{nbsp} +

== Dogfooding In Action

For internal development and dogfooding purposes we use an link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/dedicated[OpenShift Dedicated] cluster with GitHub identity provider setup. Under the `Users` tab, all the accounts that have access to the cluster are listed e.g.

image::/assets/img/advanced-authorization/user.png[OpenShift User]
{nbsp} +

There are a few teams working on {prod} with the corresponding OpenShift Groups created and managed on the cluster:

image::/assets/img/advanced-authorization/groups.png[OpenShift Groups]
{nbsp} +

Each OpenShift group explicitly defines a set of users that belong to it:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Group
apiVersion: user.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: che-team-a
users:
  - ibuziuk
  - ...
----

The `advancedAuthorization` property of the {prod} Custom Resource explicitly defines the groups which are allowed:

[source,yaml]
----
  networking:
    auth:
      advancedAuthorization:
        allowGroups:
          - che-team-a
          - che-team-b
          - che-docs
----

Users who do not belong to the groups from the list above are not allowed to use {prod}. This configuration allows the cluster administrator to explicitly manage the onboarding and curate the access.
