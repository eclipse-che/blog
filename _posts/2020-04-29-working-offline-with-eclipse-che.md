Eclipse Che has many thousands of users. Most of them use the VS Code-inspired browser IDE, but sometimes you know you’re going to be offline for awhile and want to be able to work with a local editor, then sync back your changes when you’re back online.

Obviously if you only care about changes to the source code then git will handle this just fine. But if you want to run it offline, make changes to your tools, runtimes or dependencies then it’s great to be able to have all that synced back to Eclipse Che.

In this article we’ll cover how to set this up, by:

1.  Updating your Eclipse Che workspace to allow rsync.
2.  Importing files into your local computer/laptop.
3.  Edit/work with your project on your laptop
4.  Synchronize back all code changes from your laptop to the remote workspace.

### Prerequisites

### 1\. On my laptop: check all tools are available

*   Check local installation of `rsync` on the laptop by trying to execute the command `$ rsync`.
*   Check installation of `kubectl` to execute remote `rsync` command.
*   Check installation of the`oc` CLI if Eclipse Che is running on OpenShift.

These tools will need to be on your local machine if they’re not already.

### 2\. In Eclipse Che Workspace

The `rsync` tool needs to be part of the workspace.

Note: with OpenShift we could use `oc rsync` command. But there is no exclude filter taken into account, for example. So in this blog post I will use only `kubectl` and `rsync`.

Your Eclipse Che workspaces may include several running containers. (Workspace pod). Let’s add a new container that will manage only `rsync` operations.

I will use the `rsync` tool included in the image `quay.io/fbenoit/rsync-simple` so no need to build it.

The image includes the following:

FROM alpine:latest  
...  
RUN apk add --no-cache rsync  
...

As you can see this just adds the `rsync` tool inside the smallest container possible (based on `alpine` linux).

I’ve also added an entry-point to keep the container always-on, and an extra permissions to make it compliant with the random user-id generated by OpenShift.

### Workflow

### 1\. Updating your Eclipse Che workspace to allow rsync

The `devfile` is responsible of the definition of the Eclipse Che workspace.

Edit the `devfile` of the workspace from the Eclipse Che dashboard:

As seen in prerequisites, `rsync` tool needs to be part of the workspace and by default it’s not there. Let’s add a new `rsync` component and let it have access to `/projects` folder using `mountSources: true`

Add this component into `components` section (or create a new `components` section first if it’s not there).

undefined

Now restart the workspace to finish the inclusion of this new `rsync` component. You can check if you’ve been successful by opening the workspace in an IDE and opening the Workspace panel (the cube icon on the right of the IDE):

### 3\. Importing files into your local computer/laptop

To share files on our laptop and use `rsync`, we will need some information.

1.  `kubectl` ready-to-use (authentication performed)
2.  The name of the running remote workspace pod
3.  An `rsync` bash script

### 3.1. kubectl

In my example, I am using the online Eclipse Che instance hosted on `che.openshift.io.` I will copy the command to be able to log into OpenShift instance.

I can use the OpenShift web console to do that. To get the web console link, open a terminal inside the IDE by using the Workspace panel within the IDE.

undefined

Open a terminal inside the Theia IDE container for example. Then type:

$ echo ${CHE\_OSO\_CLUSTER//api/console}

It will display the URL of the console:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*i0COfDvwSTNLulHk.png)
undefined

Use command+click on [https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/](https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/)  
It will open link in default browser. Note that your workspace might be assigned to a different cluster, so the URL might be different as well.

When logged in in the OpenShift console:

*   Open the top right corner link
*   Click on `copy Login command` and execute that command on your laptop.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cW62ijAisPJtRFrD.png)
undefined

copy the `oc` login command and execute it on your laptop:

$ oc login [https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com](https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com) — token=tHeEnCoDeDtOkEn  
Logged into “[https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com:443](https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com:443)" using the token provided.

Then use your namespace (ending with -che) using `oc project <namespace>` command:

$ oc project <namespace>-che

And we can check that the workspace pod is there by using `oc get pods` or `kubectl get pods` commands.

### 3.2. Name of the workspace pod

We will copy files from the remote workspace to our local machine.

We need the name of the workspace. It is available from a terminal with the following command:

$ echo $HOSTNAME

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FNc5U92npf5UhCs8.png)

Another way is to use the `kubectl` or `oc` tool to find the workspace pod name (`$ kubectl get pods` or `$ oc get pods`).

The name of the container that includes `rsync` is “rsync” as it’s the alias name we defined in the `devfile`.

### 3.3. The rsync script

To import the project files into Eclipse Che workspace, we will now use `rsync.`

We will need a shell script to perform the copy and this script will use `kubectl exec` command.

Create a new file `kubectl-rsync.sh` with the following content:

undefined

Don’t forget to make it executable: `chmod u+x kubectl-rsync.sh` and now let’s assume you copy it to `${HOME}/bin` folder.

Now, let’s create another script named `workspace-sync.sh`

undefined

Apply permissions by using `chmod u+x workspace-sync.sh`.

Copy it, for example, to `${HOME}/bin` folder. We’re using the `-e` option in rsync parameters to specify another shell.

Now that our scripts have been setup, it’s time to use them.

First, we store the workspace pod into an env variable:

$ export WORKSPACE\_POD=workspacelmog4zkmikhxpc87.workspace-74d787cf95-xbd26

Let’s proceed to the first import.

Assuming our remote workspace has files in `/projects/` and that we want to copy workspace files it to `${HOME}/my-workspace` on our laptop, execute the following command:

$ RSYNC\_OPTIONS="--progress --stats" RSYNC\_FROM="${WORKSPACE\_POD}:/projects/" RSYNC\_TO="${HOME}/my-workspace" ${HOME}/bin/workspace-sync.sh

Now files are being transferred into our laptop.

We see progress due to `--progress` option. You may add`--exclude ‘node_modules'` in `RSYNC_OPTIONS` for nodejs projects to exclude unwanted files.

In your laptop you should see `my-project` folder in `${HOME}` directory.

### 4\. Edit/work with your project on your laptop

Well here, you can do whatever you like with your project that has been synchronized to `${HOME}/my-workspace/my-project`

For example if it’s a java/maven project you can run `mvn` command there or run `yarn` for nodejs project, etc.

### 5\. Synchronize back all the changes

All modified files are now on your local computer so you can edit them. But at some point you’ll want those changes back in the remote Che workspace.

We’ll use the same `workspace-sync.sh` script but we’ll reverse the source and destination. Because now we want to copy laptop’s changes to the remote workspace and not the previous way. Also, we’ll set this time `RSYNC_INFINITE=true` to do rsync every 15s (to never miss local changes).

$ RSYNC\_FROM="${HOME}/`my-workspace`/" RSYNC\_TO="${WORKSPACE\_POD}:/projects/" RSYNC\_INFINITE="true" ${HOME}/bin/workspace-sync.sh

You can drop `--progress --stats` from `RSYNC_OPTIONS` so you don’t generate too much output now that you’ve confirmed it works.

One issue is that when syncing back the changes, we don’t want to upload the whole node\_modules folder. Adding the `--exclude node_modules` parameter takes care of that.

RSYNC\_OPTIONS="--exclude node\_modules"

The script now checks all the changes every 15 seconds.

All changes from my filesystem are now inside my remote workspace.

Let’s check:

### 6\. Finishing

When we’re done working we can double-check that the rsync script has finished to copy all files remotely and then delete the project on our laptop.

One you have this all set up it’s easy to either leave it running all the time and fluidly move from editing on your laptop and editing in the cloud. Or only turn it on when you know you’ll be offline for awhile (like for a trip).
