== Introduction

What if the most important skill for a developer was no longer writing code, but writing specifications? The traditional development cycle is a grind of boilerplate, configuration, and repetitive tasks. We spend more time on the "how" than perfecting the "what." But a new paradigm, powered by AI, is shifting that dynamic, and you can try it yourself right now.

I'm talking about **specification-driven development**, a workflow where the developer's primary role is to create a detailed, machine-readable blueprint of an application. To prove it, I built a full-stack URL shortener. The vast majority of my time was spent crafting a perfect specification file; an AI did the rest with a single command.

== The Tools and the Paradigm

This experiment relies on a powerful combination of modern tools working in synergy:

- link:https://eclipse.dev/che/[**Eclipse Che**]: A robust cloud IDE that provides a consistent, containerized environment. It runs entirely in a browser, with workspaces defined as code, eliminating any "it works on my machine" issues.
- link:https://www.ra-aid.ai/[**RA.Aid**] & link:https://aider.chat/#[**Aider**]: A pair of AI assistants. **RA.Aid** is the master planner, taking a high-level spec and breaking it down into an implementation plan. **Aider** is the hands-on coder, executing the plan and modifying the code.

Together, they enable a shift where you, the developer, transition from a coder to an architect. Your focus is on high-level decisions, defining robust data models, crafting clean API contracts, and designing intuitive user interactions. The specification file becomes the single source of truth that drives the entire development process.

== How to Replicate This: From Repo to Running App

You can follow these exact steps to see the process for yourself.

=== Step 1: The Blueprint Repo

Everything you need to start is in this GitHub repository: link:https://github.com/akurinnoy/demo-spec-driven-development-with-ai[akurinnoy/demo-spec-driven-development-with-ai]

This repo contains the blueprint for our entire project. It includes two crucial files: the `spec.md`, which provides the detailed instructions for the AI, and the `devfile.yaml`, which defines the Eclipse Che workspace.

=== Step 2: Launch the Workspace with a Devfile

The `devfile.yaml` is the key to a one-click setup. It tells Eclipse Che to create a workspace using a pre-configured container image (`quay.io/che-incubator/cli-ai-tools:latest`) that already includes **RA.Aid** and **Aider**. This means your development environment comes ready with all the specialized AI tools installed.

=== Step 3: Secure Your AI's Access

To work, the AI assistants need access to a Large Language Model (LLM). **RA.Aid** and **Aider** are flexible and support many different providers, including Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and more. For this demo, we'll use the Gemini API.

The recommended way to provide credentials is by creating a Kubernetes `Secret`. Eclipse Che will then automatically mount this secret as an environment variable inside your workspace. For the Gemini API, the required environment variable is `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

You can create the secret for Gemini with the following command:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<EOF
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: gemini-api-key
  labels:
    controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace: 'true'
    controller.devfile.io/watch-secret: 'true'
  annotations:
    controller.devfile.io/mount-as: env
data:
  GEMINI_API_KEY: [base64 encoded Gemini API key]
type: Opaque
EOF
```

If you prefer to use a different provider, simply consult the **RA.Aid** or **Aider** documentation for the correct environment variable name (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and adapt the secret accordingly.

=== Step 4: Unleash the AI

Once you have crafted the `spec.md` for the application of your dreams, all it takes is this one command in the terminal to set the AI to work:

```sh
ra-aid --use-aider --cowboy-mode --show-cost --track-cost --msg-file spec.md
```

This command tells **RA.Aid** to use your `spec.md` file as its guide, leverage **Aider** for code modifications, and run autonomously without needing interactive approval (`--cowboy-mode`).

Instantly, the agent will parse the specification and begin building the application right inside your Eclipse Che workspace, just as it did for my URL shortener. See the whole process unfold in the video below.

As the agent works, you can follow its progress directly in the terminal. The output shows its step-by-step thinking process as it interprets the specification, plans its actions, and executes them.

It will generate the backend, the frontend, and any necessary scripts. You can see the complete, well-structured project created by the AI in the file explorer.

=== Welcome to the Future

Writing a detailed specification requires deep thought, but that upfront investment pays off massively by automating the hours of coding and debugging. After the agent finishes, you have a fully working application.

This isn't about replacing developers. It's about empowering them with tools that handle the tedious, repetitive work, freeing us to focus on what truly matters: building great software.
