We installed {prod} on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster integrated with AAD (Azure Active Directory) according to link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/installing-che-on-microsoft-azure/[instruction]. To our surprise it did not work. So, we decided to spend some time and make it workable.

NOTE: Taking into account that {prod} calls {kubernetes} API server using user's identity tokens generated by Identity Provider, AKS needs to be integrated with AAD, otherwise AKS will reject the token. Details how to integrate AKS with AAD can be found link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/managed-aad[here].

== Challenge 1: AKS does not accept id_token
{prod} sends `id_token` for installations made for {kubernetes}. But in our case AKS does not accept `id_token` (it only accepts `access_token`) due to AAD integration enabled.

.AKS rejects id_token
image::/assets/img/why-che-could-not-work-under-aks/aks-does-not-support-id_token.png[AKS does not accept id_token]

. {prod} is configured to use AAD as Identity Provider.
. AAD provides an `access_token`, `id_token`, and a `refresh_token`.
. {prod} sends the `id_token` to AKS API Server.
. AKS API Server requires `access_token` and returns auth error.

=== How did we pass the first challenge
Obviously we need a way to ask {prod} to send `access_token` instead of `id_token`. We opened the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/21450[che-operator enhancements] and proposed the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/pull/1400[improvements].

In consequence of proposed improvements new configuration field `identityToken` has been introduced into {prod} starting version 7.50+. And user can easily configure what token to be passed to upstreams in CheCluster CR (Custom Resource):
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networking:
    auth:
      identityToken: access_token
----
There are two types of tokens supported: `id_token` and `access_token`. Default value is `id_token`.

NOTE: The field `identityToken` is specific to {prod} installations made for Kubernetes only and ignored for OpenShift.

== Challenge 2: No way to obtain proper access token accepted by AKS
This is a continuation of Challenge 1 in a way that after we taught {prod} to leverage `access_token` instead of `id_token` to access AKS, we need to make sure this `access_token` is accepted by AKS.

When AKS integration with AAD is enabled, AKS expects OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens issued to the certain application, pre-registered in AAD: 'Azure Kubernetes Service AAD Server'.

.Azure Kubernetes Service AAD Server application
image::/assets/img/why-che-could-not-work-under-aks/aks-aad-server-app.png[Azure Kubernetes Service AAD Server]

If we leave default settings of oauth-proxy, leveraged in che gateway, it uses standard set of OIDC scopes and for them AAD returns an `access_token` that can be used against Microsoft Graph, not AKS.

In order to obtain a token suitable for AKS, additional scope should be configured for oauth-proxy, representing Azure Kubernetes Service AAD Server application:
[source,yaml]
----
6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630/.default
----
where GUID is a Application ID for AKS registered in AAD.

=== How did we pass the second challenge
New configuration field `oAuthScope` has been introduced into {prod} starting version 7.50+ in scope of already opened link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/21450[che-operator enhancements] and provided link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/pull/1400[improvements]. So user can easily configure authorization scopes in CheCluster CR:
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networking:
    auth:
      oAuthScope: openid email profile 6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630/.default
----
NOTE: The field `identityToken` is specific to {prod} installations made for {kubernetes} only and ignored for OpenShift.

== Challenge 3: Che server requires mandatory 'email' claim which is absent in AKS access_token
Besides passing OIDC token to AKS for authorization purposes, Che server (one of the important {prod} link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/server-components/[components]) also uses it for creating a 'user' record in internal database. There are two pieces of information (claims) about current user that Che server expects to extract from the token: name and email. Che allows configuring of user name claim via CheCluster CR in AKS (`CHE_OIDC_USERNAME__CLAIM` according to link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/next/administration-guide/advanced-configuration-options-for-the-che-server-component/#_che_oidc_username_claim[documentation]), but email claim name is hardcoded to `email` and cannot be changed. This hardcode becomes a problem for AKS setup since `access_token` returned by AAD for AKS does not contain `email` claim (see current structure below), and customization is not possible here since AKS application registration in AAD is maintained by Microsoft.

=== How did we pass the third challenge
The same as above, we need some enhancements on {prod} side to allow user to configure what token claim need to be used to extract user email. As we did it before, we opened the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/21515[che-server enhancement] and proposed the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/pull/324[improvement].

Now user can configure email claim to be used when parsing JWT token:
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  components:
    cheServer:
      extraProperties:
        CHE_OIDC_EMAIL__CLAIM: unique_name
----
If not defined, the fallback value is `email`.

== Conclusion
In this post, we talked about the challenges we met during {prod} installation on AKS and explained how to pass them using the latest versions of the product.

Now, user has all needed things configurable to be able to run successfully {prod} on AKS. For example, in our particular case we prepared yaml file that overrides the default values in CheCluster CR.
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networking:
    auth:
      identityProviderURL: https://sts.windows.net/{TENANT_ID}/v2.0/
      identityToken: access_token
      oAuthClientName: {CLINET_ID}
      oAuthSecret: {CLIENT_SECRET}
      oAuthScope: openid email profile 6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630/.default
  components:
    cheServer:
      extraProperties:
        CHE_OIDC_AUTH__SERVER__URL: https://sts.windows.net/{TENANT_ID}/v2.0/
        CHE_OIDC_EMAIL__CLAIM: unique_name 
----

* `TENANT_ID` - Directory (tenant) ID, see Figure 3.
* `CLINET_ID` - Application (client) ID, see Figure 3.
* `CLIENT_SECRET` - Client secret, you can manage it in 'Certificates & secret' section

WARNING: Don't forget to configure API permissions to authorize your application to call AKS Server API.

.AKS API permissions

After all preparations are completed, `chectl` deploy command can be used to install {prod} on AKS using yaml file above:
[source,shell]
----
chectl server:deploy \
--platform=k8s \
--installer=operator
--che-operator-cr-patch-yaml=che.yaml \
--skip-oidc-provider-check \
--skip-cert-manager \
--domain=eclipse-che-demo.mydomain.com
----

NOTE: In our case we already configured `cert-manager` and created `domain` according to the link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/installing-che-on-microsoft-azure/[instruction].
