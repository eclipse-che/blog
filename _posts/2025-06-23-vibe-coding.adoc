== Introduction

This all started in the early February 2025 from this very link:https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383[post] on X:

[quote, Andrej Karpathy, Vibe Coding]
There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

Now Vibe Coding (or AI-First Coding) is embraced by the link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Dk7sTba2I[Big Tech] and quickly becoming the new norm:

== AI Coding Assistants

AI coding assistants can significantly accelerate developer workflows by offering code suggestions, completions, and contextual assistance. DevSpaces as a Cloud Development Environment (CDE) is an isolated, repeatable, and on-demand workspace—often ephemeral—that offers a key advantage for AI assistants: developers don’t have to worry about misbehaving AI tools, MCP agents, or other integrations breaking their local setup, since any issues remain contained within the environment itself.

TIP: You need to setup it once, API key will be persisted in the browser settings
 
== Conclusion

Vibe Coding represents a paradigm shift in software development, moving from meticulous line-by-line implementation to a more intuitive, conversational, and results-driven workflow. As we've seen, this AI-first approach, powered by increasingly sophisticated Large Language Models, allows developers to focus on the 'what' rather than the 'how', accelerating innovation and making development more accessible.

Cloud Development Environments like Eclipse Che provide the perfect sandbox for this new era. They offer isolated, reproducible workspaces where developers can experiment with powerful AI assistants like Roo Code without fear of disrupting their local setups. The combination of a CDE and an AI assistant creates a powerful synergy, enabling rapid prototyping and iteration.

The journey into Vibe Coding is just beginning. We encourage you to embrace the flow, experiment with these new tools, and discover how they can transform your own development process. The future of coding is not about replacing developers, but empowering them with tools that amplify their creativity and productivity.

Happy Vibe Coding!
