            <p>
              In the first post, I described what needed to be done to make Che
              workspaces run Java 9 (which means getting the Che server to run
              Java 9 too).
            </p>

            <p>
              Now I want to explain what had to be done so contributors to the
              Che project could compile and run with Java 9.
            </p>

            <p>
              The latest Eclipse Che stable release (v5) was designed and built
              on top of Java 8. So when a new version of the JDK, Java 9, was
              released we had to ensure that Eclipse Che could be built and run
              on top of Java 9 as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eclipse Che uses many dependencies and in order to be compliant
              with Java 9 all dependencies need to be compliant as well. So
              making Eclipse Che compliant with Java 9 required a lot of
              updates.
            </p>

              Compiling Eclipse Che with Java 9
            </h3>

            <p><strong>Maven and Java 9</strong></p>

            <p>
              We had numerous failures when we first tried to build Eclipse Che
              with Java 9. Eclipse Che uses maven to build the project but when
              trying to build it most of the existing maven plugins were not
              ready to use Java 9 so we had to wait for those plugins to be
              updated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Plus, as an Eclipse project when we update a component we have to
              file a CQ (<a
                href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contribution_Questionnaire#Third_Party_Libraries"
                >Contribution Questionnaire</a
              >) for each one. With 20+ plugins to update it meant getting
              approval for each one.
            </p>

              ></a>
            </p>

            <p>
              After those plugins were updated, we still had issues around some
              Java components. Most of the failures were linked to the fact that
              in Java 9 the system class loader is no longer a
              <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                >URLClassLoader</code
              >
              and many components assumed that and performed a cast to
              <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                >URLClassLoader</code
              > …which would fail.
            </p>

            <p><strong>JDK Reflection / Internal Classes</strong></p>

            <p>
              The easiest problem to solve was with JDK reflection. We had some
              methods that performed internal introspection of JDK classes but
              these methods were not used anymore so instead of trying to fix
              them we simply removed them!

            </p>

            <p>
              Until Java 9, when you required classes provided by
              <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                >tools.jar</code
              >
              you had to add a system dependency in your pom.xml by using the
              path to the
              <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                >tools.jar</code
              >
              file:
            </p>

            <dependency>

              <artifactId>tools</artifactId>
              <scope>system</scope>
              <systemPath
                >${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar&lt;/systemPath
                &lt;/dependency&gt; With Java 9, `tools.jar` is no longer there
                (modularity!) and classes are available with the JVM so we
                instead added this dependency in a maven profile that is only
                enabled if the Java version is lower than Java 9.

                  </dependencies>
                </profile>

                **Compiling?** At that point when we tried to compile Eclipse
                Che by disabling all unit tests and checks it _almost_ worked.
                All the modules were marked `_“build success”_` until the last
                module that tried to build GWT app which…failed…oh no! **GWT and
                Java9** This meant we had to upgrade to GWT 2.8.2 to get Java 9
                compliance. Note that you still have to use Java 8 language
                features, but GWT 2.8.2 allows you to use a Java 9 runtime.

                After all these compiling dependencies updates it was finally
                possible to build Eclipse Che with Java9! But we really wanted
                to have unit tests working as well! ;-) **Che and Unit Tests
                with Java9** We were using Mockito 1.x in Eclipse Che but to get
                Java 9 support we needed Mockito 2.10. This meant converting all
                existing tests to Mockito 2.x. This was quite a bit of work
                because some of classes which were deprecated in 1.x were
                removed in 2.x while other methods (like `any()`) handle `null`
                differently. Last but not least, we were using a maven artifact
                named `mockito-all` and this artifact is no longer supported on
                2.x so we had to remove it everywhere it was used (many, many
                places…). Now tests could be launched but some failures were
                still reported on EclipseLink and Apache Lucene — the versions
                that we were using of those were not compliant with Java 9.
                After upgrading EclipseLink to 2.7.0, and Lucene to 7.0.1 the
                issues were solved. For Lucene we’d previously used version
                5.2.1 so it was a big update to move to 7.0.1. **GWT Mockito
                **As before the last unit tests that needed fixing were related
                to the GWT Mockito tests. Specifically, there was an issue with

                great — Eclipse Che was compiling, tests were working, but could
                we launch Che with Java 9? Quick answer…no :-( Eclipse Che uses
                APIs provided in the `javax` namespace (`javax.activation` and
                `javax.xml.bind`). With Java 9, all packages that are not in
                the`java` namespace are not exposed by default. So we had to
                enable extra modules when using Java 9 or higher:
                JAVA\_OPTS="$JAVA\_OPTS --add-modules java.activation
                --add-modules java.xml.bind" You may notice that the name of the
                modules are just `java.xxx` not `javax.xxx` — that’s not a typo,
                `java.activation` provides the `javax.activation` package at
                runtime. With that flag Eclipse Che was finally able to start!
                But there was a big stack trace in Tomcat saying that the
                `logging.properties` file was not found. This file was found in
                `java.home/lib` folder previously but in Java 9 it’s moved to
                the `conf` folder. So we needed a Tomcat version change that
                included that fix. [**Tomcat - Dev - svn commit: r1809831 - in

                By using Tomcat 8.5.23 we could move forward. Finally! **Eclipse
